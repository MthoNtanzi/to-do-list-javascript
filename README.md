Perfect — here’s a **GitHub-portfolio–ready README** you can **copy and paste as-is**.
It’s concise, professional, and clearly communicates **intent, skills, and learning value** (which recruiters care about).

# 📝 Vanilla JavaScript To-Do List

A clean and functional **to-do list application built with pure JavaScript**, HTML, and CSS.
This project focuses on strengthening front-end fundamentals by implementing common application features **without using frameworks or libraries**.

---

## 🎯 Project Goal

The purpose of this project is to build a solid understanding of how modern front-end frameworks work under the hood by manually handling:

* Application state
* DOM updates
* User interactions
* Data persistence

This foundation makes it easier to transition into frameworks such as **React** and **Vue**.

---

## ✨ Features

* Add new tasks
* Mark tasks as completed
* Delete individual tasks
* Clear completed tasks
* Persist tasks using `localStorage`
* Prevent empty task submissions

---

## 🧠 Concepts Demonstrated

* DOM manipulation with vanilla JavaScript
* Event-driven programming
* State management using JavaScript arrays
* Conditional rendering
* Data persistence with the Web Storage API
* Clean separation of logic and UI rendering

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **HTML5**
* **CSS3**
* **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)**

*No frameworks. No libraries.*

## ⚙️ How It Works

* Tasks are stored in a JavaScript array acting as the application state.
* Any change to the data triggers a UI re-render.
* DOM updates are handled manually using native JavaScript methods.
* Task data is saved in `localStorage` to persist across browser sessions.

---

## ▶️ Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MthoNtanzi/to-do-list-javascript.git
   ```

2. Open the project directory and launch `index.html` in your browser.

No setup or build tools required.

<!-- ## 🚀 Possible Enhancements

* Task filtering (All / Active / Completed)
* Inline task editing
* Drag-and-drop task ordering
* Accessibility improvements
* Refactor into a React application using components and hooks

--- -->

## 📌 Why This Project Matters

This project demonstrates a strong understanding of **core front-end engineering principles** and provides a solid foundation for working with modern JavaScript frameworks.

It reflects:

* Problem-solving ability
* Clean, readable code
* Framework-agnostic thinking
