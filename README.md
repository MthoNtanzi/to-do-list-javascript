# 📝 Vanilla JavaScript To-Do List

A fully functional **To-Do List application** built using **pure JavaScript**, HTML, and CSS. This project demonstrates dynamic DOM manipulation, state management, event delegation, and interactive user interfaces — all without any frameworks.

---

## 🎯 Project Goal

The purpose of this project is to build a solid understanding of how modern front-end frameworks work under the hood by manually handling:

* Application state
* DOM updates
* User interactions
* Data persistence

This foundation makes it easier to transition into frameworks such as **React** and **Vue**.

---
## Features

- Add tasks with **title** and **priority** (low, medium, high, urgent)
- Mark tasks as **completed** by checking the box
- **Remove tasks** from the list
- **Filter tasks** by All, Active, or Completed
- **Modal form** for adding tasks
- Maintains **state internally** using a JavaScript array
- Dynamic **DOM updates** with event delegation
- Fully responsive and interactive UI

---

## 🧠 Concepts Demonstrated

* DOM manipulation with vanilla JavaScript
* Event-driven programming
* State management using JavaScript arrays
* Conditional rendering
* Data persistence with the Web Storage API
* Clean separation of logic and UI rendering

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **HTML5**
* **CSS3**
* **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)**

*No frameworks. No libraries.*

## ⚙️ How It Works

* Tasks are stored in a JavaScript array acting as the application state.
* Any change to the data triggers a UI re-render.
* DOM updates are handled manually using native JavaScript methods.

## ▶️ Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MthoNtanzi/to-do-list-javascript.git
   ```

2. Open the project directory and launch `index.html` in your browser.

No setup or build tools required.

---

## Usage

1. Click **"Add Task"** to open the modal form.
2. Enter a task title and select a priority.
3. Click **"Create Task"** to add the task.
4. Click the **checkbox** to mark a task as completed.
5. Click **Remove** to delete a task.
6. Filter tasks using the **All / Active / Complete** radio buttons.
